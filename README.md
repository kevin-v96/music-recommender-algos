Various music recommender algorithms

Started out with a Graph Neural Network (LightGCN) based recommendation for the Spotify Million Playlists Challenge Dataset
For that one, I followed the tutorial at https://medium.com/@benalex/implement-your-own-music-recommender-with-graph-neural-networks-lightgcn-f59e3bf5f8f5 and referred to their code.

Going to add other algorithms for the same dataset and see how they do comparatively.
